abstract: One of the greatest challenges facing polymeric cardiovascular devices is the issue of hemocompatibility. Devices such as polymeric heart valves potentially offer improved mechanical properties and quality of life compared to their animal tissue counterparts. However, they are still strongly limited by problematic interactions with blood. The reduction of platelet adhesion, thrombogenicity, and calcification have been addressed in a variety of surface and bulk modification methods, generally by increasing the hydrophilic character of polymers. However, most hydrophilization processes – oxygen plasma in particular – tend to offer limited longevity. The crystallinity of polymers has previously been observed to influence the extent of platelet adhesion, though the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon are not clear. In this research, we report on the effect of crystallinity on hemolysis, thrombogenicity, and platelet adhesion in PEEK surfaces. By tailoring the bulk crystallinity, we demonstrate changes in the surface chemical composition and propose a potential strategy to achieve longer term surface modification for improved hemocompatibility. Additionally, we explore the influence of crystallinity on the mechanical properties of thin PEEK films, establishing the multi-dimensional impact of polymer crystallinity. The results shown here may have implications for the design of polymeric cardiovascular devices and considerations that should be taken during material selection.
