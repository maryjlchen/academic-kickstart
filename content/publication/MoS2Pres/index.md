abstract: Single layer graphene-based materials and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hold significant promise for next-generation supercapacitors because of their high theoretical surface area and their ability to be assembled into dense electrodes. While significant research has emerged in the last few years devoted to MoS2 and graphene-MoS2 hybrid electrode systems, little is known regarding fundamental double-layer charging mechanisms in this system. The goal of this study is to determine the potential and frequency dependent area-specific double-layer capacitance of the electrode/electrolyte interface using the 1T and 2H polymorphs of MoS2. Furthermore, we aim to understand restacking effects and possible intercalation mechanisms in MoS2-MoS2 and MoS2-graphene films. To by-pass the challenges and uncertainties associated with porous electrodes, we carry out measurements on non-porous monolayer electrodes supported by atomically flat graphite single crystals. Monolayer films were prepared from colloidal dispersions of chemically exfoliated molybedum disulfide (MoS2) and chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. The films were characterized to determine surface coverage, surface roughness, layer number and electrode material chemistry. The frequency and voltage-dependent capacitance of monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer films were measured by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the metallic 1T polymorph of MoS2 has over fourfold the capacitance of the semiconducting 2H polymorph but a complicated voltage-dependence. While the capacitance of rGO films does not increase with increasing layer number, the capacitance of 1T-MoS2 films scaled with layer number, even at high frequency, suggesting easy and rapid ion intercalation between the restacked sheets. Measurements on heterostructures of rGO-MoS2 are currently being studied. The results of these studies allow us to determine the limiting factors and upper limits of capacitance expected from MoS2 composites and provides engineering design criteria for building higher performance MoS2 composite electrodes.
