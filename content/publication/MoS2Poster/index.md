abstract: Single layer 2D materials such as the metallic, 1T polymorph of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hold significant promise for next-generation supercapacitors due to their high theoretical surface area and ability to be assembled into electrodes with high bulk density boosting volumetric capacitance. While significant research has emerged in the last few years devoted to MoS2 and graphene-MoS2 hybrid electrode systems, little is known regarding fundamental double-layer charging mechanisms in this system. In this work, we determine the potential and frequency dependent area-specific double-layer capacitance of the electrode/electrolyte interface using the 1T and 2H polymorphs of MoS2. Furthermore, we aim to understand restacking effects and possible intercalation mechanisms in multilayer MoS2 films, as well as how the intrinsic capacitance can be enhanced by defect engineering.
