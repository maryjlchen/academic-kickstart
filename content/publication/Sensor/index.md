abstract: Many surgical procedures use lasers to ablate biological tissue, such as laser photocoagulation for preventing retinal detachment. For these procedures to succeed, the amount of heat generated by the laser at the point of contact must be carefully monitored, and there is currently no way to do this reliably. To this end we propose the use of molecular beacon probes with temperature-dependent fluorescence properties. These probes, encased in a gel matrix to be representative of the human eye, will act as an accurate, real time, non-invasive temperature sensor. Our design consists of a frequency-regulated system in which fluorescence is extracted from the probes and converted into a real-time temperature signal. Awarded the Nanotechnology Engineering Design Symposium Award for excellent poster and presentation.
